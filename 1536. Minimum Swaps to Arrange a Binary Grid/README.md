Given an n x n binary grid, in one step you can choose two **adjacent rows** of the grid and swap them.

A grid is said to be **valid** if all the cells above the main diagonal are **zeros**.

Return the minimum number of steps needed to make the grid valid, or **-1** if the grid cannot be valid.

The main diagonal of a grid is the diagonal that starts at cell (1, 1) and ends at cell (n, n).

 

**Example 1:**

![1536_example_1](https://github.com/wilwfy/LeetCode/blob/master/1536.%20Minimum%20Swaps%20to%20Arrange%20a%20Binary%20Grid/1536_example_1.jpg)
```
Input: grid = [[0,0,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,0]]
Output: 3
```
**Example 2:**

![1536_example_2](https://github.com/wilwfy/LeetCode/blob/master/1536.%20Minimum%20Swaps%20to%20Arrange%20a%20Binary%20Grid/1536_example_2.jpg)
```
Input: grid = [[0,1,1,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,1,1,0]]
Output: -1
Explanation: All rows are similar, swaps have no effect on the grid.
```
**Example 3:**

![1536_example_3](https://github.com/wilwfy/LeetCode/blob/master/1536.%20Minimum%20Swaps%20to%20Arrange%20a%20Binary%20Grid/1536_example_3.jpg)
```
Input: grid = [[1,0,0],[1,1,0],[1,1,1]]
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**

- n == grid.length
- n == grid[i].length
- 1 <= n <= 200
- grid[i][j] is 0 or 1

**Hint 1**  
For each row of the grid calculate the most right 1 in the grid in the array maxRight.

**Hint 2**  
To check if there exist answer, sort maxRight and check if maxRight[i] â‰¤ i for all possible i's.

**Hint 3**  
If there exist an answer, simulate the swaps.
