/**
 * Official solution of Brute Force [Accepted]
 *
 * Intuition
 * We store an array self.overlaps of intervals that are double booked, and self.calendar for
 * intervals which have been single booked. We use the line start < j and end > i to check if
 * the ranges [start, end) and [i, j) overlap. This is because:
 * Evidently, two events [s1, e1) and [s2, e2) do not conflict if and only if one of them starts
 * after the other one ends: either e1 <= s2 OR e2 <= s1. By De Morgan's laws, this means the events
 * conflict when s1 < e2 AND s2 < e1.
 * 
 * The clever idea is we do not need to "clean up" ranges in calendar: if we have [1, 3] and [2, 4],
 * this will be calendar = [[1,3],[2,4]] and overlaps = [[2,3]]. We don't need to spend time transforming
 * the calendar to calendar = [[1,4]].
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N^2), where N is the number of events booked. For each new event,
 *                  we process every previous event to decide whether the new event can
 *                  be booked. This leads to âˆ‘k~N O(k) = O(N^2) complexity.
 * Space Complexity: O(N), the size of the calendar.

/**
 * Official solution of Boundary Count [Accepted]
 * 
 * Intuition and Algorithm
 * 
 * When booking a new event [start, end), count delta[start]++ and delta[end]--. When processing
 * the values of delta in sorted order of their keys, the running sum active is the number of
 * events open at that time. If the sum is 3 or more, that time is (at least) triple booked.
 *
 * Think of this as "scanning" from left to right with a "vertical laser". Every
 * endpoint (a start point, or an end point) is an event. A start point is +1, an
 * end point is -1. The accumulated value "count" would be the number of "active"
 * intervals which is cut by the vertical laser.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N^2), where N is the number of events booked. For each new event,
 *                  we traverse delta, here is eventCntMap, in O(N) time.
 * Space Complexity: O(N), the size of delta, here is eventCntMap.
