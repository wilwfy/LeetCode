# LeetCode
LeetCode solutions.

Always try to optimize time complexity O(n^2) -> O(nlogn) or O(n) in most cases.

Python Tips:
1. Dictionary build-in method keys() will not return a list object. To get a list of keys, need try list(newdict.keys()). This will convert the dict_keys object to a list.
2. Dictionary (Hash Table) should be considered in priority to deal with the duplicated information or the mapping relationship.
3. For Linked List problem, using/creating a dummy head is usually needed.
4. For Linked List problem, the middle element of a list can be found by using a slow and a fast pointers together.

Java Tips:


Data Structure Implementation:
1. An implementation of Trie can be found in 720. Longest Word in Dictionary
2. An implementation of Max Heap can be found in 692. Top K Frequent Words
