LeetCode solutions.

Always try to optimize time complexity O(n^2) -> O(nlogn) or O(n) in most cases.

Python Tips:
1. Dictionary build-in method keys() will not return a list object. To get a list of keys, need try list(newdict.keys()). This will convert the dict_keys object to a list.
2. Dictionary (Hash Table) should be considered in priority to deal with the duplicated information or the mapping relationship.
