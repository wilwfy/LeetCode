 * Let f(n) be the probability that the n-th passenger will get his own seat.
 * If the 1st passenger get the 1st seat, then everyone will get their own seats, so the n-th passenger gets his own seat
 * with probability: 1/n
 * If the 1st passenger get the 2nd seat, with probability 1/n, then n-1 seats left. Here, the 2nd passenger faces the same
 * situation of the 1st passenger, he can just randomly choose a seat. So it is the same question but n becomes n-1. In this
 * situation, the probability that the n-th passenger gets his seat is f(n-1). So the final probability is f(n-1)*(1/n)
 * If the 1st passenger get the 3rd seat, ..., the probability is f(n-2)*(1/n)
 * ...
 * ....
 * ......
 * Then f(n) = 1/n + f(n-1)*(1/n)+ f(n-2)*(1/n) + ... + f(2)*(1/n)
 * Let's solve this recursive formula:
 * nf(n) = 1+ f(n-1)+ f(n-2) + ... + f(2) ...... Equation 1
 * (n-1)f(n-1) = 1+ f(n-2)+ ... + f(2) ...... Equation 2
 * Use Equation 1 - Equation 2
 * nf(n) - (n-1)f(n-1) = f(n-1)
 * so
 * f(n) = f(n-1) when n>=3
 * We already know f(2)=0.5
 * So f(n) = 0.5 when n>=2
