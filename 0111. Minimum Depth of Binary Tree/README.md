Easy

Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

**Note:** A leaf is a node with no children.

 

**Example 1:**

![111_example-1](https://github.com/wilwfy/LeetCode/blob/master/0111.%20Minimum%20Depth%20of%20Binary%20Tree/111_example-1.jpg)
```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 2
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: root = [2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]
Output: 5
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 105].
- -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
