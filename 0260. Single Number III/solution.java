/**
 * Other's solution of Two Pass
 *
 * Explanation
 *
 * Once again, we need to use XOR to solve this problem. But this time, we need to do it in two passes:
 * 
 * In the first pass, we XOR all elements in the array, and get the XOR of the two numbers we need to find.
 * Note that since the two numbers are distinct, so there must be a set bit (that is, the bit with value '1')
 * in the XOR result. Find out an arbitrary set bit (for example, the rightmost set bit).
 * 
 * In the second pass, we divide all numbers into two groups, one with the aforementioned bit set, another with
 * the aforementinoed bit unset. Two different numbers we need to find must fall into thte two distrinct groups.
 * XOR numbers in each group, we can find a number in either group.
 *
 * Time: O(n)
 * Space: O(1)
