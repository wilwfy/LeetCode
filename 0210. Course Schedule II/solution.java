/**
 * Official solution of DFS
 *
 * Algorithm
 * 1. Initialize a stack S that will contain the topologically sorted order of the courses in our graph.
 * 2. Construct the adjacency list using the edge pairs given in the input. An important thing to note about the input for the problem is that a pair such as [a, b] represents
 *    that the course b needs to be taken in order to do the course a. This implies an edge of the form b âž” a. Please take note of this when implementing the algorithm.
 * 3. For each of the nodes in our graph, we will run a depth first search in case that node was not already visited in some other node's DFS traversal.
 * 4. Suppose we are executing the depth first search for a node N. We will recursively traverse all of the neighbors of node N which have not been processed before.
 * 5. Once the processing of all the neighbors is done, we will add the node N to the stack. We are making use of a stack to simulate the ordering we need. When we add the
 *    node N to the stack, all the nodes that require the node N as a prerequisites (among others) will already be in the stack.
 * 6. Once all the nodes have been processed, we will simply return the nodes as they are present in the stack from top to bottom.
 * 
 * Complexity Analysis
 * Time Complexity: O(N) considering there are N courses in all. We essentially perform a complete depth first search covering all the nodes in the forest. It's a forest and
 *                  not a graph because not all nodes will be connected together. There can be disjoint components as well.
 * Space Complexity: O(N), the space utilized by the recursion stack (not the stack we used to maintain the topologically sorted order)

/**
 * Official solution of BFS with using Node Indegree
 *
 * Intuition
 * We first process all the nodes/course with 0 in-degree implying no prerequisite courses required. If we remove all these courses from the graph, along with their outgoing
 * edges, we can find out the courses/nodes that should be processed next. These would again be the nodes with 0 in-degree. We can continuously do this until all the courses
 * have been accounted for.
 *
 * Algorithm
 * 1. Initialize a queue, Q to keep a track of all the nodes in the graph with 0 in-degree.
 * 2. Iterate over all the edges in the input and create an adjacency list and also a map of node v/s in-degree.
 * 3. Add all the nodes with 0 in-degree to Q.
 * 4. The following steps are to be done until the Q becomes empty.
 *    1. Pop a node from the Q. Let's call this node, N.
 *    2. For all the neighbors of this node, N, reduce their in-degree by 1. If any of the nodes' in-degree reaches 0, add it to the Q.
 *    3. Add the node N to the list maintaining topologically sorted order.
 *    4. Continue from step 4.1.
 *
 * Complexity Analysis
 * Time Complexity: O(V + E) where V represents the number of vertices and E represents the number of edges. We pop each node exactly once from the zero in-degree queue and
 *                  that gives us V. Also, for each vertex, we iterate over its adjacency list and in totality, we iterate over all the edges in the graph which gives us E.
 *                  Hence, O(V + E)
 * Space Complexity: O(V + E). We use an intermediate queue data structure to keep all the nodes with 0 in-degree. In the worst case, there won't be any prerequisite
 *                   relationship and the queue will contain all the vertices initially since all of them will have 0 in-degree. That gives us O(V). Additionally, we
 *                   also use the adjacency list to represent our graph initially. The space occupied is defined by the number of edges because for each node as the key,
 *                   we have all its adjacent nodes in the form of a list as the value. Hence, O(E). So, the overall space complexity is O(V + E).
